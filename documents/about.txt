🏗 Project Breakdown – Quick Job Application Tracker
🎯 Core Problem

Job seekers apply to dozens of jobs but forget:

Which companies they applied to

The date they applied

When to follow up

The status of each application

Your app solves this by keeping everything organized in one place.

🔑 Key Features

Here’s what I suggest for MVP (Minimum Viable Product):

Authentication

Users can register/login.

Each user only sees their own job applications.

Job Application CRUD

Add new job application:

Company Name

Position / Role

Job Source (LinkedIn, Email, Referral, etc.)

Date Applied

Status (Applied, Interview, Offer, Rejected)

Notes (optional)

Edit or Delete applications.

Search & filter applications (by status/company).

Follow-Up Reminder

After X days (customizable), system sends an email notification:

“It’s been 7 days since you applied to Google for Backend Developer. Time to follow up?”

Dashboard

Show a summary chart:

Total Applied

Interviews Scheduled

Offers Received

Rejections

Quick filters (see only Applied, only Rejected, etc.).

Export

Option to export all data as CSV for record keeping.
